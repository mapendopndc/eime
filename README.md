# eime
Engineering Intelligence Management Engine

## Structure
- eime is the primary logic behind this workflow
- Fatigue is an example of a "formula library" that engineers could create themselves and share
- Library_MN is an example of a compilation of formulas that an engineer could make for themselves. Here they could import a mix of their own formula libraries and other colleagues' libraries
- SteelColumnDesigner is an example of a use case for this sort of library. These jupyter notebooks could essentially be a new way of creating well-documented design aids
